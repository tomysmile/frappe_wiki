### Lazy loading images on website

Browsers now support the lazy loading of images natively. If you were using Framework's lazy loading trick you can simply replace it with native lazy loading. 

```diff
- <div class="website-image-lazy" data-class="img-class" data-src="image.jpg" data-alt="image"></div>
+ <img class="img-class" src="image.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy"></img>
``` 

### Return type of various date utilities. 


- `get_year_ending` used to return string date instead of `datetime.date`. This behavior is now made consistent with other utilities.
- `get_timespan_date_range` used to return string date tuples for some cases, now it always returns `datetime.date` tuples.


### No default index on `modified` field in child tables

Frappe v15 will drop the default index on `modified` field because it was seldomly used. 

If your queries require an index on the `modified` field you should selectively add it on your doctypes.
